# Clustering-Advanced-Practical-Machine-Learning


# Exercise Requirements
	1. Implement a K-means++ function and test it on synthetic data.
	2. Write a spectral clustering function and test it on synthetic data 
	3. Demonstrate that you can use the \elbow" method or Silhouette in order to choose k correctly for synthetic data
	4. Apply your K-means and spectral clustering to the microarray data set. Use K-selection methods to find signifcant clusters. Visualize the results and the selection process
	5. Familiarize yourself with the t-SNE algorithm using MNIST and a toy dataset
